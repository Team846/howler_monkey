Files placed in this directory will be deployed to the RoboRIO into the
  'deploy' directory in the home folder. Use the 'frc::filesystem::GetDeployDirectory'
  function from the 'frc/Filesystem.h' header to get a proper path relative to the deploy
  directory.


To be able to deploy code, create a file called dev.id in this deploy folder. 
The contents of this file should be your full name: First Last
Dev.id should be added to gitignore
